How many quantitative? What do they represent?

Is there missing data or data that seems to be wrong somehow (e.g. age = -99)?

Some of the units of measurement for the food commodities are in "Days" which does not logically compare against other values such as Kilograms or Liters.

Has the data already been summarized, or are the observations raw and unprocessed?
The food prices from MMK to USD has already been converted.

# Potential Avenues of Inquiry
Initial data exploration often sparks additional questions or potential insights that could be supported by continued exploration.

What types of questions does this dataset seem to support?

Be especially on the lookout for avenues of inquiry that produce a tangible value (the ability to make better targeted or informed decisions, or some other potential benefit to stakeholders).

This data set would support policymakers' and NGOs' analysis on where to invest more resources in Myanmar during periods of instability. This data can also predict which commodities are most in demand and where.
